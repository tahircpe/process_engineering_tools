    "# Material Stream in Process Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Any chemical and biochemical process consists of material streams interacting with a series of unit operations and unit processes. Information about material stream's state and associated properties is passed on to these operations. These operations than alter the stream's state and its properties. Hence, for the process modeling of any chemical or biochemical process, the state and properties of material streams are the essential information needed to model the unit operations and unit processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using python object-oriented programming the information and functionality of a material stream can be bundled in a python class. Creating an instance of the stream class as an object makes it easy to deploy in the process model and interact with unit operation models. Instances of the class object can be used to model all the process streams in the process model.\n",

    "# Use of [CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "[CoolProp](http://www.coolprop.org/index.html) is a an open source thermodyamic databank. It has a wrapper interface available for python. It can be used to get the thermodynamic and pyhsical properties of the material stream. More details about use of CoolProp and its python interface to get themophysical properties is given here [CoolProp â€” A Cool Package for Thermophysical Properties]. \n",

    "# Material Stream Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality needed of a material stream object varies with the type of process and detail of the process model. Hence, developing a generic material class streams that can be used in all sorts of chemical and biochemical applications is a tough task. However, a basic skeleton class that contains the essential elements can be constructed --- that can also be extended on the need basis. Following are the essential physical variables needed for process modeling of a material stream:\n",
    "\n",
    "- State variables: temperature, pressure, composition, mass or mass flowrate.\n",
    "- Thermodynamic properties: specific enthalpy, specific entropy, specific volume, quality (vapor fraction) etc.\n",
    "- Transport properties: density, viscosity, thermal conductivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic functionality needed of material stream class can be of following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate of the thermodynamic and transport properties given a defined state.\n",
    "- Mixing of streams\n",
    "- Splitting the streams\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum number of independent variables needed to define thermodynamic state of a stream depend on the number of components and number of phases. This is determined using the famous phase rule, deduced by Josiah Willard Gibbs (1875), given below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = 2 - \\pi + N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\pi$ is the number of phases, $N$ number of components, and $F$ is the number of independent variables needed to define the state of a material stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a pure component existing in one phase ($\\pi  = 1$) any two of the following can be specified: Temperature, pressure, vapor fraction (quality), or specific thermodynamic properties such as specific enthalpy, specific entropy, specific volume. In the case of a mixture, in addition to above, the composition needs to be defined."
